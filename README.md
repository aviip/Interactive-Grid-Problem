# Problem Statement (How it Works):

- The grid consists of 3 rows and 3 columns (a 3x3 grid).
- Each cell can be either "active" (set) or "inactive" (cleared).
- Clicking on an inactive cell sets it to active.
- Once all cells are set (active), a timed sequence automatically clears them one by one, with a one-second delay between each cell.
- While the sequence is running, user interaction with the grid is disabled.
